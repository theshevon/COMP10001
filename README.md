**NOTE**: As much as I do enjoy receiving them, if you're sending me memes, **please** add the subject title MEME so I can filter them out from genuine queries.

## Directory Structure
* **Tutorial Notes & Slides**: Contains the slides that I used for my weekly tutorials as well as summaries of the important content for each week.
* **Tutorial Sheets**: Contains the problem sheets for each week.
* **Tutorial Solutions**: Contains the solutions for each week's problems. Please read the instructions in the folder to find out how you can access the Jupyter Notebook files.
