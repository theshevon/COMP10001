# Intructions

* This folder contains Jupyter Notebook files which contain the solutions for the problems on the tutorial sheets.
  * **IMPORTANT:** It is not required that you know how to use Jupyter Notebook for this course. I'm only providing solutions in this format as I feel that it's quite intuitive in this form.<br/><br/>

* In order to access these files, you can either:
  * OPTION 1:
    * Click [here](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/theshevon/COMP10001/master) (Jupyter Notebook _might_ take a couple of minutes to launch)
    * Click on `Tutorial Solutions`
    * Click on the file corresponding to the desired week
  * OPTION 2:
    * Install [Anaconda Navigator](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/)
      on your machine and open the files using Jupyter Notebook.<br/><br/>

* In order to run a code block:
  1. Click on the target cell
  2. Either:
    * Click the `Run` button on the toolbar
    * Press `shift` + `return` (Mac) OR `shift` + `enter` (Win)<br/><br/>

* Feel free to edit the code and run it yourself. (The changes you make will be
  locally saved and then deleted once you end your session.)<br/><br/>
